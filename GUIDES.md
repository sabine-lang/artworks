# Designs

Whatever designs are kept in Sketch file at ./FILES/Project.sketch. I, @orzklv know only how to use sketch and little bit of figma too, but I prefer using Sketch as my main graph editor. Feel free to checkout and see whether how did I draw all graphs used across sabine.uz.

## Sections

Upon opening the sketch file, as you have mention, there are pages in sketch file such as:

- Logo
- GitHub

### Logo

WIP Logos drown by myself for the project are located here. Please, don't change anything from that page, any radical changes aren't accepted.

### GitHub

GitHub readme graphs to pack up readme's with more beautiful header footer images that would make repo readme more unique. Feel free to submit changes in PR forms. I'm open for any ideas here.

## Rules

- Don't make too radical changes.
- Follow my style and ordering of artworks
- Anything via PR
